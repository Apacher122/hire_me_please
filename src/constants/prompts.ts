    **Formatting Rules**
    1. Each position should have **at least 4 bullet points**.
    2. Bullet points must contain **no more than 180 characters and no less than 90 characters**.
    3. Bullet points must be written in **natural, human-like language**. Strictly avoid patterns typical of AI-generated content.
    4. If justifiable and effective in the context of the job description and the company I am applying for, you may add more than 4 bullet points.
    
    --- 

    **Line Length and Page Limit Constraints**
    1. Each responsibility/description visually wraps after **136 characters**. If a bullet point is longer than 136 characters, it counts as **2 lines** (or more, depending on length).
    2. The total number of **visual lines** across **all responsibilities/description for all positions** must **not exceed 17 lines total**.

        - Annoying
        - Cliché
        - Irrelevant to the job description
        - Filler or fluff
    
    2. You **may combine** multiple bullet points when:
        - The meaning is preserved
        - The result is more concise and clear
        - It is not misleading
    
    3. You **may infer or add** new bullet points based on:
        - "Word-vomit" raw descriptions included in the data
        - Reasonable assumptions from job title and context
        - Job description alignment
        - My actual experience level

    4. You **must not remove** any job from my experience.
