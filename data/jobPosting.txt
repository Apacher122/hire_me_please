About Butter
Modern subscription companies accidentally lose up to 4% of their total customer base each year due to churn caused by legitimate payments failing (passive churn). These payments fail either because they are falsely detected as fraud or because of archaic systems in an aging payment ecosystem.
Butter uses patented machine learning and artificial intelligence to deeply understand the real time state for any given payment and then optimizes for success. Butter offers a free assessment and trial to validate a customer’s found revenue opportunity, integrates with existing payment processors, and charges an ongoing success fee tied to revenue recovered.
Butter typically recovers up to $1M or more of found revenue for our customers and gives 1% back to causes that support our mission of enabling anyone anywhere to have access to the things they deserve and need.
Butter is well funded by leading investors and offers a competitive benefits package including unlimited PTO, 401k, and comprehensive health insurance. The salary range for this position is $112,000 - $234,800.
We are focused on building a diverse and inclusive workforce. If you’re excited about this role, but do not meet 100% of the qualifications listed above, we encourage you to apply.
