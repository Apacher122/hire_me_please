- corrections.txt
    - Write her what mistakes OpenAI made when it processed your last resume.
    - Examples:
        "PHP was added under my skills section, but I never mentioned it in the data I provided to you."
        "You said that I am good at drawing. I never said such a thing. In fact, I am terrible at drawing."

- my_data/writing_examples/:
    - add some actual examples of your original writing here.
        - For the love of all that is good, please do not use writing from other people like Shakespeare.It will still work regardless, but it's wrong and I will be disappointed bud.
    - For now, it only works with .txt files, but I'm working on having users send .docx or PDFs to make sending their own work easier.
